The Monkees Fan Page
===

**Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute.**

This is a fan page designed for both lovers and newcomers of the 1960s surf-rock band, The Monkees. Over four webpages, the website highlights the band’s retro appeal and stylistic relevance in the digital age. It briefly explores their history; their online presence through both social media and their ability to reach a new audience through platforms such as iTunes and Youtube, as well as their availability to perform on both their current European tour and special events.

The project had personal interest to me as I am a musician myself. I have long been fascinated by the resurgence of decade-old bands through the power of the internet. We’ve seen it with bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Beatles who have enjoyed a definite boost in popularity and new lease on life as young fans have an easier time discovering their music and history through online resources. To me, The Monkees’ are another great example of a band whose style and appeal are just ripe for the tastes of young music and fashion lovers alike.




UX
===

My ultimate goal was to create a Monkees fan-page which would satisfy both an existing fan-base while also reaching a new audience and generation unfamiliar with their work through web design and what it can offer the user in terms of experience and the band in terms of marketing and reach.

For the user who wants to learn more about the band’s history, the home page provides a brief timeline that condenses their story into minute bites and even travels vertically as a user scroll down the page. This is both an informative and efficient way to introduce the band’s story in a way that won’t overload the user with information. As well as this, the home page provides users with information for contacting the band and how to follow them through social media.

For any user interested in discovering, purchasing or simply listening to the band’s music, there’s the music page which displays a selection of albums available to purchase through iTunes with links to the relevant iTunes pages. For videos and band footage, there’s a link to their official Youtube channel along with an example of such a video users can expect from the channel.

Users who want to sample their music before visiting iTunes can also enjoy the MP3 tab at the bottom of the page which provides four of their best known tracks to enjoy at leisure while scrolling.

For information regarding tour dates and ticket availability for users who would like to see the band live, there’s a tour table which easily and comprehensively illustrates selected dates, venues and ticket status for each concert for their upcoming tour. As well as this, users interested in what to songs the band will be playing live can download the PDF file of their setlist before making any decision about purchase.

Users who wish to contact the band regarding an event or query can do so by visiting the contact page. The contact page will ask for a name, email and a brief description from the user form provided.

* Along with some experimentation on the style, the tour table structure found in “tour.html” is credited to an incredibly helpful W3School tutorial that can be found [here]( https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).
* I received inspiration from a number of sources for this project. I was curious as to how other bands of the same era were now marketing their online presence. I found the official website for The Rolling Stones to be a big influence. The developer of that website seemed to understand the importance of finding balance between respecting their history, but also contextualising and branding it as something very relevant and new. I see it in how they used font and colour, even shape to evoke something nostalgic through the design, but still keep it very lively and intriguing to coax someone unfamiliar with the band to journey further into the site. You can take a look [here](https://www.rollingstones.com/).
* A special thanks to the lecturers and coordinators at Code Institute for their tutorials and instruction through the User-Centric Frontend Development module. Their website can be found [here](https://codeinstitute.net/)
* Lastly, to my parents, Seamus and Susan, for their constant support and help throughout the prep and creation of this Milestone project.
