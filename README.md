The Monkees Fan Page
===

**Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute.**

This is a fan page designed for both lovers and newcomers of the 1960s surf-rock band, The Monkees. Over four webpages, the website highlights the band’s retro appeal and stylistic relevance in the digital age. It briefly explores their history; their online presence through both social media and their ability to reach a new audience through platforms such as iTunes and Youtube, as well as their availability to perform on both their current European tour and special events.

The project had personal interest to me as I am a musician myself. I have long been fascinated by the resurgence of decade-old bands through the power of the internet. We’ve seen it with bands such as The Rolling Stones and The Beatles who have enjoyed a definite boost in popularity and new lease on life as young fans have an easier time discovering their music and history through online resources. To me, The Monkees’ are another great example of a band whose style and appeal are just ripe for the tastes of young music and fashion lovers alike.

* I received inspiration from a number of sources for this project. I was curious as to how other bands of the same era were now marketing their online presence. I found the official website for The Rolling Stones to be a big influence. The developer of that website seemed to understand the importance of finding balance between respecting their history, but also contextualising and branding it as something very relevant and new. I see it in how they used font and colour, even shape to evoke something nostalgic through the design, but still keep it very lively and intriguing to coax someone unfamiliar with the band to journey further into the site. You can take a look [here](https://www.rollingstones.com/).
